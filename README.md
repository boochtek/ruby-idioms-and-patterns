# Ruby Programming Idioms and Patterns

This is a (potential) book about idioms and patterns in Ruby.


## Inspirations

I've given several talks about patterns and idioms, especially in Ruby.
That has inspired me to collect more of them in a book form.

In a way, this is a clean-room reimplementation of Kent Beck's _Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns_.
That's definitely the biggest inspiration.
But I'd also like to incorporate ideas from several other books:

* _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby_ by Sandi Metz
* _99 Bottles of OOP_ by Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen
* _Confident Ruby_ by Avdi Grimm
* _Exceptional Ruby_ by Avdi Grimm
